              "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure form professonals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstandig. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have infact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers"
